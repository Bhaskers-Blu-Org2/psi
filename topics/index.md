# In-Depth Topics

The links below provide additional information about various, more in-depth topics relevant when writing Platform for Situated Intelligence applications or new components. The pages that do not have links are under construction, and should be available soon.

## Runtime

| Topic | Description |
| :----------- | :---------- |
| [Basic&nbsp;Stream&nbsp;Operators](/psi/topics/InDepth.BasicStreamOperators) | Describes a core set of stream operators like `Select`, `Do`, `Where`, etc. |
| [Synchronization](/psi/topics/InDepth.Synchronization) | Describes synchronization primitives and the `Join` mechanism for fusing multiple streams in more detail. |
| [Window&nbspOperators](/psi/topics/InDepth.Window) | Describes operators that provide window views over streams. |
| [Datasets](/psi/topics/InDepth.Datasets) | Describes the infrastructure and APIs for working with datasets in \\psi. |
| [Writing&nbsp;Components](/psi/topics/InDepth.WritingComponents) | Describes how to write new \\psi components. |
| Pipeline&nbsp;Execution | Describes how to control the execution of the pipeline. |
| [Delivery&nbsp;Policies](/psi/topics/InDepth.DeliveryPolicies) | Describes delivery policies and how to control message flow in the pipeline. |
| [Remoting](/psi/topics/InDepth.Remoting) | Describes how remoting works and how to construct distributed \\psi applications. |
| [Interop](/psi/topics/InDepth.Interop) | Describes how to interoperate with systems outside of \\psi using standard data formats and transports. |
| Cooperative&nbsp;Buffering | Describes how to make use of the cooperative buffering facilities in the fabric to minimize memory allocations when using large data types. |
| [Intervals](/psi/topics/InDepth.Intervals) | Explains the `Interval` data type and how to work with absolute and relative time intervals. |
| [Event&nbsp;Source](/psi/topics/InDepth.EventSource) | Explains how to create source streams based on Windows events. |
| Debugging | Provides some tips and tricks on how to debug \\psi applications. |
